The authorship of the Book of Hebrews has been a subject of scholarly debate for centuries, with various hypotheses proposed regarding its origin.
In this GitHub project, titled "HebrewsAuthorship," we employ unsupervised learning techniques and data visualization models, including t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding), to determine the Pauline authorship of the Book of Hebrews. 
Additionally, we aim to explore the stylistic characteristics of Hebrews within the New Testament canon.

1. Data Collection:
The project begins by gathering textual data from the Book of Hebrews, as well as from other Pauline epistles and New Testament writings attributed to different authors. Utilizing publicly available datasets or scraping textual content from reputable sources, we compile a comprehensive corpus for analysis.

2. Feature Extraction and Representation:
Next, textual features are extracted from the collected data to represent the linguistic characteristics of each text. Techniques such as bag-of-words, n-grams, and word embeddings are employed to capture semantic and syntactic information. Additionally, metadata features such as word frequency distributions, sentence lengths, and vocabulary richness may be considered.

3. Unsupervised Learning Models:
Unsupervised learning algorithms, such as clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques, are applied to the feature-rich dataset. Clustering algorithms like k-means or hierarchical clustering may group texts based on similarities in their linguistic features. Dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE are utilized to visualize high-dimensional data in lower-dimensional space while preserving local structures.

4. Authorship Attribution:
By analyzing clustering patterns and visualizing text embeddings using t-SNE, the project aims to infer the authorship of Hebrews within the context of other Pauline writings. By comparing the linguistic signatures of Hebrews with those of known Pauline epistles, insights into its authorship can be derived. Statistical analyses and qualitative assessments may complement the results to provide a comprehensive understanding.

5. Stylistic Analysis within the New Testament Canon:
Beyond authorship attribution, the project delves into the stylistic characteristics of Hebrews within the broader context of the New Testament canon. Comparative analyses of vocabulary usage, sentence structures, rhetorical devices, and theological themes are conducted to discern unique stylistic traits. Insights gained from these analyses contribute to a deeper understanding of Hebrews' literary and theological significance.

Conclusion:
"HebrewsAuthorship" represents a pioneering effort in employing unsupervised learning and data visualization techniques to explore the authorship and stylistic features of the Book of Hebrews. By leveraging advanced methodologies and interdisciplinary approaches, the project aims to shed light on one of the most intriguing mysteries of biblical scholarship. Through open collaboration and transparent methodologies, we endeavor to advance scholarly discourse and enrich our understanding of ancient texts.
